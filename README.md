# MachineLearning

We download a historical dataset from previous loan applications, clean the data, and apply the following classification 
algorithms:

- K-Nearest Neighbour
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine
- Logistic Regression

We use the following metrics to measure the accuracy of each classifier:
Jaccard index,
F1-score,
LogLoass
